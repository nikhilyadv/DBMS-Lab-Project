\section{Use Cases}
Lets for this case assume that we a supplier. We first want to register and then add products to sell.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{login1.png} 
    \caption{Login page.}
\end{figure}
So at the login page we will select SignUp. It will then open up the SignUp page.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{signup1.png}
    \caption{SignUp page(Selecting role).}
\end{figure}
Since we are Supplier we will select supplier option and then proceed.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{signup2.png}
    \caption{SignUp page(Entering Details).}
\end{figure}
After entering the details press the Register button. It will display that the user is successfully created.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{signup3.png}
    \caption{SignUp page(Conformation).}
\end{figure}
After registering goto the login page by pressing the Switch to Login button.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{login2.png} 
    \caption{Login page(Entering Details).}
\end{figure}
After login you will be taken to a welcome page which will have two options for you 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Either to add new products in the market.
    \item Or to change the quantites or price of existing products. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{supp1.png} 
    \caption{Welcome page for Supplier.}
\end{figure}
So lets add a new product. You will be taken to a page which will ask to fill the details of the product.
\begin{figure}[H]
